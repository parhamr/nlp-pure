Natural language processing algorithms implemented in pure Ruby with minimal dependencies.

NOTE: this is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way connected with [Pure NLP](http://purenlp.com/), a trademark of John La Valle.

This project aims to provide functionality similar to [Treat](https://github.com/louismullie/treat), [open-nlp](https://github.com/louismullie/open-nlp), and [stanford-core-nlp](https://rubygems.org/gems/stanford-core-nlp) but with fewer dependencies. The code is tested against English language but the algorithm implementations aim to be flexible for other languages.


## Requirements

TODO


## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```
gem 'nlp-pure'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install nlp-pure
```


## Usage


### Word Segmentation

```
$ bundle exec irb
irb(main):001:0> require_relative './lib/nlp_pure/segmenting/default_word'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> NlpPure::Segmenting::DefaultWord.parse 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'
=> ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog."]
irb(main):003:0> NlpPure::Segmenting::DefaultWord.parse 'The New York-based company hired new staff.'
=> ["The", "New", "York", "based", "company", "hired", "new", "staff."]
irb(main):004:0> NlpPure::Segmenting::DefaultWord.parse 'The U.S.A. is a member of NATO.'
=> ["The", "U.S.A.", "is", "a", "member", "of", "NATO."]
irb(main):005:0> NlpPure::Segmenting::DefaultWord.parse "Mary had a little lamb,\nHis fleece was white as snow,\nAnd everywhere that Mary went,\nThe lamb was sure to go."
=> ["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb,", "His", "fleece", "was", "white", "as", "snow,", "And", "everywhere", "that", "Mary", "went,", "The", "lamb", "was", "sure", "to", "go."]
```


## Supported Ruby Versions

This library aims to support and is [tested against](https://travis-ci.org/parhamr/nlp-pure) the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 2.0
* Ruby 2.1
* Ruby 2.2
* [JRuby](http://www.jruby.org/)
* [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/)

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.


## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Violations
of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch
version is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be
immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be
introduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and
should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version
Constraint](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16#page74) with two digits of precision. For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency 'nlp-pure', '~> 0.1'
```
